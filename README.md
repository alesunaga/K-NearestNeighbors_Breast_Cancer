# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier for Breast Cancer Prediction

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the application of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for breast cancer classification using the scikit-learn library.

## Overview

The script performs the following tasks:

1.  **Data Loading:** Loads the breast cancer dataset from scikit-learn.
2.  **Data Splitting:** Splits the dataset into training and validation sets.
3.  **KNN Classifier Training and Evaluation:** Trains a KNN classifier for different values of `k` (number of neighbors).
4.  **Optimal K Search:** Evaluates the classifier's performance for each `k` and identifies the optimal `k` that maximizes accuracy.
5.  **Visualization:** Generates a plot showing the accuracy of the classifier for different values of `k`.
